## Project Chimera: Bridging the Gap Towards Real-World Cybernetic Limbs with AI-powered Control Systems

**Vision:**

Imagine a world where cybernetic limbs, like those seen in science fiction, become a reality. This project aims to bridge the gap between fiction and reality by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a foundation for advanced control systems in cybernetic limbs, specifically arms at this stage of the project.

**Current State:**

Cybernetic limbs exist today, but their dexterity and control often fall short of what we see in movies. With AI and advancements in robotics, we can push the boundaries of what's possible. I love seeing cybernetic limbs in movies, and I want this dream that I have had for a while to become reality, in a coding state at least. I don't have the equipment to actually create limbs, but I hope somebody uses my code (and credits me of course) to create cybernetic limbs.

**This Project:**

This project utilizes AI to develop a flexible and adaptable codebase for controlling cybernetic limbs. We believe this code will serve as a valuable starting point for researchers and developers working towards creating more advanced and user-friendly cybernetic arms.

**Goals:**

* **Foundational Framework:**  Develop a robust and efficient control system using C++ that lays the groundwork for future cybernetic limb advancements.
* **AI for Enhanced Control:**  Explore the use of AI for real-time learning and adaptation, allowing the cybernetic arm to respond more naturally to user intent.
* **Ease of Use and Customization:** Design the code with modularity and user-friendliness in mind, making it easy for developers to customize and expand functionality for various needs.

**Disclaimer:**

This project is for educational and research purposes only. It is not intended for medical applications. Developing real-world cybernetic limbs requires expertise in various fields and strict adherence to safety regulations. Also, I decided to use C++ because it is better for my use case and possibly others, but error handling will pose a problem, so I am finding a workaround that offers the same pros, but with better error handling. 

**Contributing:**

We welcome contributions from the robotics, AI, and open-source communities! This is an ambitious project, and your expertise can help us move closer to the future of cybernetic limbs. Feel free to give me some more ideas of the project, and with proper equipment, I hope that people can use my code to create proper cyberetic limbs. 


**Getting Started (placeholder):**

* (This section will be filled in later as the project progresses. I will breifly explain prerequisites in due time.)


**Next Steps:**

* (This section will be filled in later with specific steps for those interested in contributing or using the codebase.)

**Remember:** Safety is paramount. While this project explores the potential of AI in cybernetic limbs, real-world applications require collaboration with qualified professionals and adherence to safety regulations. I am also trying my best to fix theproblem with error handling capabilities, I am open to ideas.
